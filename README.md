# About project

This repository is a copied version of one of the capstone project I did during a Bootcamp.
Currently, I am translating the original project written in Python into R for a hands-on practice purpose.

### About data
PaySim is a financial mobile money simulator devised for fraud detection. The data generated by PaySim is based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. Hence, we can benefit from this simulated data, which is similar to the original records, to conduct fraud analytics overcoming the lack of public access to private records.

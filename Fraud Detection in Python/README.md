 PaySim is a financial mobile money simulator devised for fraud detection. The data generated by PaySim is based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. Hence, we can benefit from this simulated data, which is similar to the original records, to conduct fraud analytics overcoming the lack of public access to private records.

 Here, we used [one of PaySim’s public datasets available on the Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1).
Using this synthetic data, we aim to understand better all the features related to fraudulent profit by data analysis and make good predictions on the unseen data based on our findings. To enhance prediction performance, we implemented different machine learning algorithms and evaluated each model.

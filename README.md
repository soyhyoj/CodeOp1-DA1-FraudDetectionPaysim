 PaySim is a financial mobile money simulator devised for fraud detection. The data generated by PaySim is based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. Hence, we can benefit from this simulated data, which is similar to the original records, to conduct fraud analytics overcoming the lack of public access to private records.

 Here, we used [one of PaySim’s public datasets available on the Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1).
Using this synthetic data, we aim to understand better all the features related to fraudulent profit by data analysis. To enhance the accuracy of predictive models, we implemented different machine learning models to generate better predictions on frauds and evaluated each of their performances.
